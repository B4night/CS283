## Overall Feedback:
The story is a well-written retelling of the legend of Romulus and Remus with strong structure and language. However, it doesn't significantly deviate from or deeply explore beyond the traditional myth, offering limited creativity and character depth. To improve, it could benefit from more original angles, emotional depth, and vivid world-building details.
