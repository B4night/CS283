"Today, brothers, we shall either conquer or die!"

This quote has been passed down through history as a testament to the bravery and determination of the Byzantine Emperor, who refused to surrender even in the face of overwhelming odds.

It continues to be referenced in popular culture and is often used to symbolize the determination and courage of those who stand in the face of adversity. |
