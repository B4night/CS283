It was a chilly autumn morning in September 1939 when the world changed forever. The once-peaceful streets of Warsaw, Poland, were filled with an eerie sense of anticipation. The air was thick with tension as the Polish military prepared for the inevitable invasion by the German army.

For months, the world had been watching the escalating tensions between Nazi Germany and Poland. The German dictator, Adolf Hitler, had been making aggressive demands for Polish territory, and the Polish government had refused to give in. The situation had been building towards a catastrophic showdown, and now it seemed that the war was finally about to break out.

At 4:45 am, a German radio broadcast announced the start of the invasion, and the Polish military sprang into action. Artillery fire erupted across the border as German troops poured into Poland, intent on crushing the Polish resistance. The Polish air force scrambled to defend their skies, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned.

As the news of the invasion spread, the world watched in horror. The British and French governments, bound by a treaty to defend Poland, began to mobilize their own military forces. The British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, who had been trying to appease Hitler for years, finally realized that the Nazi dictator was not to be trusted.

The German invasion was swift and brutal, with troops advancing deep into Polish territory. The Polish military fought valiantly, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. Cities like Warsaw and Krakow were bombarded with artillery fire, and civilians were caught in the crossfire.

As the days passed, the situation grew more dire. The Polish government, led by President Ignacy Moscicki, was forced to flee the capital city, and the country was plunged into chaos. The Polish people, who had been living in fear of the Nazi occupation for months, were now facing the very real possibility of being conquered and enslaved.

The world was shocked and outraged by the German invasion, and the war had officially begun. The United States, which had been trying to remain neutral, was now forced to take a stance. President Franklin D. Roosevelt called on Congress to declare war on Germany, and on December 11, 1941, the United States officially entered the conflict.

The start of World War II marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict that would last for six years and claim the lives of millions of people. It was a war that would change the course of history, and leave a lasting impact on the world.

In the end, the Polish people would suffer greatly, with an estimated 2-3 million civilians and soldiers killed during the invasion. The country would be occupied by Germany for the next five years, and the Polish resistance would fight bravely against the Nazi occupation.

The start of World War II would also mark the beginning of a new era of international relations, as the world realized that the old system of appeasement and diplomacy had failed. The war would ultimately lead to the formation of the United Nations, and a new commitment to collective security and the protection of human rights.

As the world looks back on the events of September 1939, it is clear that the start of World War II was a pivotal moment in history. It marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict that would change the course of the world, and leave a lasting impact on future generations.
