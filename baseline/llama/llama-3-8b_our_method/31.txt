Here is the combined story:

The Council of Tordesillas
It was a sweltering summer day in June 1494 when the Council of Tordesillas, a gathering of high-ranking officials from the Portuguese and Spanish crowns, convened in the small town of Tordesillas, Spain. The purpose of the meeting was to settle a contentious issue that had been brewing for months: the division of the newly discovered lands outside Europe.

The year was 1492, and Christopher Columbus's first voyage had opened up a whole new world to European exploration. The Portuguese, led by King John II, had already established a foothold in the west coast of Africa, while the Spanish, under the rule of Ferdinand and Isabella, had claimed the lands entered by Columbus.

The Pope, Alexander VI, had attempted to mediate the dispute by drawing a line of demarcation down the middle of the Atlantic, giving all lands west of the line to Spain and those east of it to Portugal. However, this proposal had been met with resistance from both sides, and the issue remained unresolved.

The Council of Tordesillas was tasked with finding a new solution to the problem. After weeks of negotiations, the delegates finally reached an agreement. The treaty, signed on June 7, 1494, established a meridian line 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. Any lands to the east of this line would belong to Portugal, while those to the west would belong to Spain.

The treaty was a major victory for the Spanish, who had long been seeking to expand their dominions in the Americas. However, it was not without its drawbacks. The Portuguese, who had already established a foothold in the west coast of Africa, would now have to cede their claims to the lands west of the meridian line.

Despite the controversy surrounding the treaty, it marked an important milestone in the history of the New World. For the first time, the two major powers of Europe had formally divided the newly discovered lands between them, paving the way for further exploration and colonization. Little did they know that their treaty would have far-reaching consequences, shaping the course of history for centuries to come.

The Divided New World

As the sun rose over the small town of Tordesillas, Spain, a sense of anticipation filled the air. The Spanish monarchs, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, had gathered the most powerful men in their kingdom to discuss a matter of great importance: the division of the New World.

The Treaty of Tordesillas, signed on June 7, 1494, marked a significant turning point in the history of exploration and colonization. The agreement, brokered by Pope Alexander VI, aimed to resolve the dispute between Spain and Portugal over the newly discovered lands.

The treaty established a meridian line running through the Atlantic Ocean, with all lands west of it belonging to Spain and those east of it to Portugal. The line was set at 370 leagues (approximately 2,100 kilometers or 1,300 miles) west of the Cape Verde Islands, which were already under Portuguese control.

The Spanish delegation, led by King Ferdinand's emissary, Juan de Fonseca, had arrived in Tordesillas several weeks prior to the signing of the treaty. They had been in intense negotiations with the Portuguese representatives, led by King Manuel I's ambassador, Diogo de Alcáçova.

The Portuguese had initially been reluctant to agree to the treaty, as they believed the line should be farther west. However, the Spanish had been adamant that the line should be drawn at a point that would give them control over the vast riches of the New World.

As the ink dried on the treaty, the implications of the agreement became clear. The Spanish would claim the Caribbean, Central America, and much of South America, including present-day Colombia, Peru, and Chile. The Portuguese, on the other hand, would retain control over the eastern coast of South America, including present-day Brazil.

The treaty would have far-reaching consequences for the indigenous peoples of the New World. Many would be subjected to forced conversion, slavery, and violence at the hands of the European colonizers. The treaty would also set the stage for centuries of conflict and competition between Spain and Portugal over the riches of the New World.

As the Spanish delegation departed Tordesillas, they carried with them the knowledge that their country had secured a significant advantage in the race to claim the New World. Little did they know that this decision would shape the course of history for generations to come.

The Consequences of Division

As the ink dried on the Treaty of Tordesillas, the world was forever changed. The division of the New World between Spain and Portugal had far-reaching consequences that would shape the course of history.

In the years that followed, Spain focused its attention on the territories it had acquired, establishing colonies and missions in the Americas. The conquistadors, led by men like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro, brought back tales of gold and riches,
