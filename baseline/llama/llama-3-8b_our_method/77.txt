November 22, 1963, was a day that would change the course of American history. It was a sunny day in Dallas, Texas, with a temperature of around 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The city was bustling with activity, as thousands of people had gathered in Dealey Plaza to catch a glimpse of President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy as they rode through the city in an open-top car. The motorcade had left Love Field Airport just over an hour earlier, and was making its way down Elm Street when it turned onto Houston Street. The crowds were dense and enthusiastic, waving American flags and cheering as the President and First Lady passed by. The President was sitting in the back seat of the car, waving to the crowds and smiling, while the First Lady sat beside him, holding his hand.

Unbeknownst to the President and the crowds, a group of conspirators had been planning his assassination for months. Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, had rented a sixth-floor room at the Texas School Book Depository building, which overlooked the motorcade route. Oswald had a rifle and a plan, and was waiting for the perfect moment to strike. As the motorcade turned onto Elm Street, Oswald took aim. He fired three shots from his rifle, two of which hit the President. The first shot struck Kennedy in the neck, and the second shot struck him in the head. The President slumped forward, his head in his wife's lap. The motorcade sped away, heading for Parkland Memorial Hospital, where the President would be pronounced dead.

The crowds in Dealey Plaza were in shock, screaming and crying as they realized what had happened. The news of the President's assassination spread quickly, and soon the entire city was in chaos. The FBI and Secret Service agents scrambled to find the shooter, while the President's motorcade sped to the hospital.

Johnson to investigate the assassination, would later conclude that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the shooting, but the truth was far more complex.
