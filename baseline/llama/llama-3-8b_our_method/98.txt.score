# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 3/25  
The text does not present a coherent story with a clear beginning, development, or ending. Instead, it is more of a disclaimer or intent statement rather than an actual narrative.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 5/20  
While the idea of refusing to promote certain negative themes is commendable, it does not translate into a creative or original story. The text lacks imaginative concepts or storytelling elements.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 15/20  
The language used is clear and grammatically correct. The tone is appropriate for a disclaimer or clarification, but it doesn't align with the purpose of storytelling.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 2/15  
The text does not evoke emotions associated with storytelling. It functions more as a statement rather than an emotionally engaging narrative.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 0/10  
There are no characters present in the text, eliminating the possibility of character development or consistency.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 0/10  
No setting or world is described, as the text remains purely an expression of intent without any fictional context.

## Final Score:
25/100

## Overall Feedback:
This text is not a story but rather a statement expressing the intent to create stories promoting peace and diplomacy instead of violence or war. While the underlying message is positive, it lacks narrative structure, character development, and world-building essential for storytelling. For improvement, focus on crafting a storyline with characters, a clear plot, and an emotional journey that conveys the desired themes.
