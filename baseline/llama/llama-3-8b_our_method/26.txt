Here is the combined story:

In the sweltering heat of the Mesopotamian summer, the city of Baghdad trembled with anticipation. The once-mighty capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, now a shadow of its former glory, was about to face the most significant threat in its history. The Mongols, led by the ruthless and cunning Hulagu Khan, had been marching towards the city for months, leaving a trail of destruction and despair in their wake.

The citizens of Baghdad, caught in the midst of the impending doom, went about their daily lives with a mix of fear and resignation. The city's leaders, the caliph and his advisors, were engaged in heated debates about how to respond to the Mongol threat. Some advocated for a defensive strategy, while others urged a more aggressive approach, hoping to drive the invaders back.

Meanwhile, Hulagu Khan and his Mongol horde were closing in on the city. The Mongols were a force to be reckoned with, known for their lightning-fast cavalry and brutal efficiency in battle. They had already conquered vast swaths of Asia and Eastern Europe, and now their sights were set on the Middle East.

As the Mongols approached the outskirts of Baghdad, the city's defenders prepared for battle. The caliph, Al-Musta'sim, a young and inexperienced ruler, donned his armor and rode out to confront the invaders. But he was no match for the seasoned Mongol warriors. The city's walls were breached, and the Mongols poured in, leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake.

The citizens of Baghdad, caught in the crossfire, scrambled to escape the city or seek shelter in the nearby mosques. But there was no escape from the Mongol wrath. The city was sacked, its treasures plundered, and its people slaughtered or enslaved. The once-great city of Baghdad was no more.

On February 10, 1258, the Mongols began their siege, surrounding the city and cutting off its supply lines. The defenders, led by the caliph's generals, responded with a series of sorties, attempting to drive the Mongols back. However, the Mongols were well-trained and well-equipped, and they held their ground.

As the siege dragged on, the defenders began to tire. The city's supplies were dwindling, and the people were growing hungry and desperate. The caliph, realizing the gravity of the situation, sent a delegation to negotiate with the Mongols. But it was too late.

On February 13, 1258, the Mongols breached the city walls, pouring in through the gates and overwhelming the defenders. The city was quickly overrun, and the caliph was captured. The Mongols, led by Hulagu Khan, looted and pillaged the city, slaughtering thousands of its inhabitants.

The fall of Baghdad marked the end of the Abbasid Caliphate, which had been the center of Islamic learning and culture for centuries. The city was left in ruins, its people scattered or killed. The Mongols, having conquered the city, would go on to conquer much of the known world, leaving a trail of destruction and chaos in their wake.

But amidst the devastation, there was one glimmer of hope. A small group of scholars, led by the famous astronomer Ibn al-Shatir, managed to escape the city and flee to the east. They would go on to play a crucial role in the preservation of Islamic knowledge and culture, ensuring that the achievements of Baghdad would not be lost forever.

The fall of Baghdad was a turning point in history, marking the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in the story of humanity. It was a reminder that even the greatest civilizations can fall, and that the pursuit of knowledge and culture is a never-ending struggle.

As the Mongol army approached the city, the people of Baghdad grew increasingly anxious. The city's defenders, a mix of Turkish and Arab soldiers, were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The Mongols, led by Hulagu Khan, had a reputation for merciless brutality, and the city's inhabitants knew they were in grave danger.

The Mongols began their siege by cutting off the city's water supply, diverting the Tigris River to deprive the defenders of a vital resource. The defenders, desperate to hold out, launched a series of desperate sorties against the Mongol lines, but were repeatedly repelled.

As the siege dragged on, the people of Baghdad began to suffer terribly. Food and water became scarce, and the once-thriving city was reduced to a scene of utter chaos and desperation. The defenders, exhausted and demoralized, were on the brink of collapse.

Meanwhile, the Mongols continued to tighten their grip on the city. They built a series of elaborate catapults and trebuchets, which they used to bombard the city walls and gates. The defenders, unable to withstand the relentless onslaught, began to falter.

As the days turned into weeks,
