## Overall Feedback:
The story provides a good recount of the Brexit referendum events, but it lacks a clear narrative structure with a compelling beginning, middle, and end. The repetition of events hinders the flow and coherence, impacting the overall readability. Creativity and originality suffer due to its basis on well-documented historical events, leading to a lack of novel elements or perspectives. The language is generally fluent, but there are moments where clarity is lost due to repetitive information. Emotional impact is present but diluted by a straightforward recounting rather than a deeply personal take on events. Character development is minimal, as the story focuses more on groups and their actions rather than individuals' intricacies. Lastly, the setting is factual and offers limited imaginative world-building. To improve, the story could benefit from a tighter narrative structure, more focus on unique perspectives or emotional depth, and enhanced character portrayal.
