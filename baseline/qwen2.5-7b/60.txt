The Wright brothers' first flight was a historic moment in aviation history. On December 17, 1903, Orville and Wilbur Wright successfully flew their experimental aircraft, the Wright Flyer, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This groundbreaking achievement marked the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered aircraft. The brothers had spent years developing their design, which included a unique wing-warping system for controlling the aircraft's direction. On that fateful day, Orville piloted the Flyer for a brief but historic 12-second flight, covering a distance of 120 feet. The Wright brothers' success paved the way for further advancements in aviation and inspired countless others to pursue their own dreams of flight.
