In the ancient city of Babylon, there lived a wise and just king named Hammurabi. One day, he decided to create a set of laws that would govern the people of his kingdom. He called this set of laws the Code of Hammurabi.

The Code of Hammurabi was a collection of 282 laws that covered a wide range of topics, including property rights, contracts, and criminal offenses. It was written in cuneiform script and inscribed on a large stone pillar that stood in the center of the city.

Hammurabi's Code was unique in that it was the first known written set of laws in history. It was also one of the most comprehensive and detailed codes of law ever created. The laws were based on the principle of "an eye for an eye," which meant that the punishment for a crime was equal to the harm caused by the crime.

The Code of Hammurabi was a great success, and it helped to establish order and justice in the kingdom. It was a model for other rulers to follow, and it influenced the development of law in many other cultures. Today, the Code of Hammurabi is still studied and admired for its historical significance and its contribution to the development of law.
