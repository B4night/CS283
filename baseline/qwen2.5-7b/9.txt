Once upon a time, in the year 323 BC, Alexander the Great, the renowned conqueror and military leader, fell ill in Babylon. The cause of his illness is still unknown, but it is believed to have been a combination of malaria, typhoid fever, and possibly poisoning.

Alexander's health rapidly deteriorated, and he became delirious and disoriented. Despite the best efforts of his physicians and advisors, he was unable to recover. On June 10, 323 BC, Alexander the Great passed away at the age of 32.

His death left the vast empire he had built in shambles. His generals and advisors fought amongst themselves, leading to a period of civil war known as the Wars of the Diadochi. The empire was eventually divided among his generals, and the Hellenistic period began.

Despite his untimely death, Alexander the Great's legacy lived on. His conquests spread Greek culture and language across the known world, and his military tactics and strategies continue to be studied and admired to this day.
