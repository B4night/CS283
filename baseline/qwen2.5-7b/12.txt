The beach at sunset is a breathtaking sight. The sky is painted with hues of orange, pink, and purple, casting a warm glow over the waves that gently lap against the shore. The sound of the water is soothing, and the air is filled with the scent of saltwater and sand. The sand is warm to the touch, and the waves are cool and refreshing. The sun is setting, and its rays are casting long shadows over the beach. It's a peaceful and serene moment, and it's easy to see why people love to come to the beach at sunset.
