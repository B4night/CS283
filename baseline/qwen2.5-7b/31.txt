Once upon a time, in the year 1494, the world was divided between two powerful nations: Spain and Portugal. The Treaty of Tordesillas was signed, dividing the New World in two, with Spain taking control of the western half and Portugal taking control of the eastern half. This event was a significant moment in history, as it marked the beginning of European colonialism in the Americas. It was a time of exploration, conquest, and exploitation, and the effects of this division can still be felt today.
