Part 3: The Road to Freedom

As the negotiations continued, the atmosphere in South Africa was tense. The apartheid government was struggling to come to terms with the fact that its days were numbered, while the ANC and other anti-apartheid groups were determined to bring about change.

Nelson Mandela, who had spent 27 years in prison for his fight against apartheid, was released in 1990 and quickly became a key figure in the negotiations. He was a charismatic leader who inspired hope and unity among the people of South Africa.

In 1991, Mandela and other anti-apartheid leaders met with the government to discuss the possibility of a negotiated settlement. The talks were tense and difficult, but eventually, the two sides reached an agreement.

The agreement, known as the Groote Schuur Minute, marked a major turning point in the negotiations. It established the principle of majority rule and paved the way for the first non-racial elections in South Africa's history.

In 1992, the ANC and the government signed a new bilateral Record of Understanding, which further solidified the commitment to negotiations. The document recognized the ANC as a legitimate political organization and established a framework for the country's transition to democracy.

The negotiations continued, with the two sides working to resolve their differences. In 1993, the Multi-Party Negotiating Forum was established, bringing together representatives from the ANC, the government, and other political parties.

The forum was a major breakthrough, as it provided a platform for the different parties to discuss and resolve their differences. The negotiations were intense and often contentious, but eventually, the parties reached an agreement on the country's new constitution.

The new constitution, which was adopted in 1996, established South Africa as a democratic country with a multi-party system. It also recognized the rights of all citizens, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

In 1994, South Africa held its first non-racial elections, in which all citizens, regardless of their race, were allowed to vote. The elections were a major success, with the ANC winning a landslide victory.

Nelson Mandela, who had played a key role in the negotiations, was elected as the country's first black president. He served from 1994 to 1999 and worked tirelessly to build a new, democratic South Africa.

The end of apartheid was a major turning point in South Africa's history. It marked the beginning of a new era of democracy and equality, and it paved the way for the country to become a major player on the world stage.

The legacy of Nelson Mandela and the struggle against apartheid continues to inspire people around the world. His commitment to justice and equality is a powerful reminder of the importance of fighting for what is right, even in the face of adversity.
