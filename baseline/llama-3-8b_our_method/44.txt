Here is the combined story:

January 17, 1793

The sun was setting over the city of Paris, casting a golden glow over the crowded courtroom. The National Convention, the governing body of the French First Republic, had convened to deliver its verdict on the fate of King Louis XVI. The once-mighty monarch, accused of high treason, sat in the dock, his eyes sunken and his face gaunt. Beside him, his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette, clung to his arm, her eyes brimming with tears.

The proceedings had begun hours earlier, with the reading of the charges against the king. The accusations were many and varied, from plotting with foreign powers to embezzling state funds. The king's defense team, led by the venerable lawyer Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud, had presented their case, arguing that the king was innocent of all charges and that the revolutionaries were motivated by a desire for power and revenge.

But the prosecution, led by the fiery and charismatic Maximilien Robespierre, had presented a compelling case, highlighting the king's alleged misdeeds and the suffering of the French people under his rule. The Convention had listened intently, and now it was time for the verdict.

The president of the Convention, Jean-Paul Marat, rose to his feet, his voice ringing out across the chamber. "The National Convention, having carefully considered the evidence and arguments presented, hereby finds the King Louis XVI guilty of high treason!"

The courtroom erupted into chaos, with cries of "Vive la Révolution!" and "À mort le roi!" ringing out. The king's supporters, who had filled the courtroom, were stunned and outraged, while the revolutionaries celebrated the verdict with fervor.

But amidst the chaos, one figure stood out – the king himself. His eyes, once bright with hope, had dimmed with despair. He knew that his fate was sealed, and that the next step would be the guillotine.

As the clock struck 10:00 am on January 21, 1793, the crowd outside the Place de la Révolution in Paris grew restless. The air was thick with tension and anticipation. The people had gathered to witness the execution of King Louis XVI, the last monarch of France.

Inside the prison, the King's thoughts were consumed by his family, particularly his wife, Marie Antoinette. He knew that she would be executed soon, and the thought of it was unbearable. The King's mind was also preoccupied with his children, Louis-Charles and Marie-Thérèse. He had always been a devoted father, and the thought of leaving them behind was heart-wrenching.

As the King approached the guillotine, he turned to the executioner and asked, "Do you know who I am?" The executioner, a man named Charles-Henri Sanson, replied, "Yes, I do. You are the King of France." The King then asked, "And what is your name?" Sanson replied, "I am the executioner of the King of France."

The King then turned to the crowd and said, "I die innocent. I die for my country. I die for my people." The crowd remained silent, but the King's words echoed through the streets of Paris.

With a swift and merciful stroke, the guillotine fell, and the King's life was taken. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, but the King's execution was met with widespread mourning and regret. The execution of Louis XVI marked the end of the monarchy in France and the beginning of a new era of terror and bloodshed.

The King's head was placed on a pike, and his body was buried in the Madeleine Cemetery. His wife, Marie Antoinette, would follow him to the guillotine nine months later. The fate of the French monarchy was sealed, and the country would never be the same again.
