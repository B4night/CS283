December 7, 1941, was a day that would go down in history as one of the most pivotal moments in American history. The surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, a United States naval base in Hawaii, by the Imperial Japanese Navy would draw the United States into the Second World War and change the course of the conflict forever.

It was a typical Sunday morning in Pearl Harbor, with American sailors and soldiers enjoying a day of rest and relaxation. The USS Arizona, USS Oklahoma, and USS California were docked in the harbor, their crews enjoying a morning of liberty. The air was filled with the sound of jazz music and laughter as people went about their day.

At 7:55 AM, a Japanese aircraft, a Nakajima B5N, flown by Lieutenant Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, dropped a bomb on the USS Arizona, striking the ship's forward magazine. The explosion was massive, sending a towering column of flame and smoke into the air. The USS Oklahoma and USS California were also hit, with the Oklahoma capsizing just 20 minutes later.

The attack was a coordinated effort, with multiple waves of Japanese aircraft descending upon the harbor. The Americans were caught off guard, and their defenses were quickly overwhelmed. The USS Nevada was able to get underway, but it was soon hit by a bomb, causing it to list severely.

As the attack continued, chaos erupted throughout the harbor. American sailors and soldiers scrambled to respond to the sudden attack, but they were vastly outnumbered and outgunned. The Japanese aircraft seemed to be everywhere, dropping bombs and strafing the American ships with machine gun fire.

The USS Arizona was hit again, this time by a bomb that struck the ship's aft magazine. The explosion was even more massive than the first, causing the ship to break in two and sending it to the bottom of the harbor.

The attack lasted for just over two hours, but the damage was catastrophic. The USS Arizona, USS Oklahoma, and USS California were all sunk, while the USS Nevada and USS West Virginia were severely damaged. A total of 2,403 Americans were killed, and another 1,178 were wounded.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was a devastating blow to the United States, but it also galvanized the nation. The American people were outraged by the surprise attack, and they demanded action. President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a speech to Congress, known as the Infamy Speech, in which he declared that the attack would "live in infamy" and called for a declaration of war against Japan.

The United States formally declared war on Japan on December 8, 1941, and it would go on to play a major role in the Allied victory in World War II. The attack on Pearl Harbor would always be remembered as a pivotal moment in American history, a day that changed the course of the war and the course of the nation.

In the years that followed, the United States would work tirelessly to rebuild and restore the damaged ships and infrastructure of Pearl Harbor. The USS Arizona was eventually raised from the harbor floor, but it was deemed too damaged to be repaired. Today, it remains a memorial to the lives lost on that fateful day, a reminder of the sacrifices made by the American people during World War II.

The attack on Pearl Harbor was a tragic event, but it also served as a catalyst for the American people to come together and fight for their country. It would be a day that would be remembered for generations to come, a day that would forever be etched in the hearts and minds of Americans.
