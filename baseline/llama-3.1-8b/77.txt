It was a crisp autumn morning in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. The sun was shining brightly as President John F. Kennedy's motorcade made its way through the streets of Dealey Plaza. The crowds of people lining the streets were waving and cheering, eager to catch a glimpse of the charismatic young president.

As the president's limousine turned onto Elm Street, Lee Harvey Oswald, a 24-year-old former Marine, stood on the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository building. Oswald had been a Marxist and a supporter of Fidel Castro, and he had grown increasingly disillusioned with the United States government. He had been planning the assassination of President Kennedy for months, and he had finally decided to take action.

At 12:30 PM, as the president's limousine approached the intersection of Elm and Houston, Oswald fired his rifle from the sixth floor of the depository building. The first shot hit President Kennedy in the neck, and the president slumped forward in his seat. The second shot hit him in the head, and the president's head snapped back, causing his body to lurch violently to the side.

The motorcade sped away from the scene, with the president's wife, Jacqueline, screaming in horror. The Secret Service agents in the car were quick to react, and they pushed the president's head back onto his wife's lap. But it was too late. The president was mortally wounded, and he would soon be pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital.

As the news of the president's assassination spread, panic and chaos erupted throughout the city. People were in shock, unable to believe that the young president had been taken from them in such a brutal and senseless manner. The Secret Service agents and police officers were quickly overwhelmed by the crowds of people rushing to the scene, and it took them several hours to restore order.

In the aftermath of the assassination, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the new president of the United States. The country was plunged into a period of mourning, with flags flying at half-staff and Americans coming together to pay their respects to the fallen leader.

Lee Harvey Oswald, meanwhile, was arrested at the Texas Theatre, a movie theater in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, after a police officer spotted him hiding in the back of the theater. Oswald was later charged with the murder of President Kennedy and the wounding of Texas Governor John Connally, who was riding in the car with the president.

On November 24, 1963, Oswald was shot and killed by night club owner Jack Ruby while in police custody. Ruby, who was a friend of the Oswald family, had been motivated by a desire to avenge the president's death and bring closure to the nation.
