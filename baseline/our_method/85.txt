In the early 1990s, Rwanda was a nation struggling under the weight of ethnic tensions that had been simmering for decades. The memories of colonial-era divisions had not faded, creating an atmosphere ripe for conflict. The Rwandan Civil War, which erupted in 1990, was a clash between the Hutu-led government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a group largely composed of Tutsi refugees. Despite the war, there was a flicker of hope for peace when the Arusha Accords were signed in 1993, aiming to establish a power-sharing government. But this hope was fragile, a whispered promise on the brink of being shattered.

On April 6, 1994, the peace that had been so delicately balanced was violently disrupted. The plane carrying President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down, sending shockwaves throughout the nation. This assassination was the spark that ignited one of the most horrific chapters in modern history: the Rwandan Genocide. In the chaos following the president’s death, the virulent propaganda that had been spread for years reached a fever pitch, culminating in a coordinated campaign of mass violence against the Tutsi and moderate Hutu populations.

Hutu extremists, fueled by long-standing animosities and systematic dehumanization of their Tutsi neighbors, took up machetes and guns, turning communities into battlegrounds. Thousands were slaughtered, often by those they once called friends or neighbors. The country was torn asunder; villages were decimated, and once-peaceful towns descended into chaos. Places of refuge, such as churches and schools, turned into scenes of slaughter as the genocide spread unchecked.

Yet within this darkness, acts of humanity persisted. Individuals like Suzana, a widowed teacher, defied the tides of hate by sheltering children in her home, and Father Jean-Claude transformed his church into a sanctuary amidst the bloodshed. These incredible acts of courage bore witness to a spirit of resilience that refused to be extinguished.

Amidst the killings, the Rwandan Patriotic Front resumed its military advance, progressively pushing back against the forces of genocide. Their advance was a beacon of hope in a landscape otherwise consumed by despair, and by July 1994, the RPF successfully ended the genocide.

Despite the ceasefire, the end of the genocide marked only the beginning of a new struggle—the struggle to rebuild. Families had been torn apart, communities devastated, and the heart of the nation had been deeply wounded. Rwanda embarked on a long path towards healing and reconciliation, a journey fraught with trials but also filled with the promise of rebirth.

In the years that followed, Rwanda emerged from its past, transformed and determined to create a future where unity triumphed over division. The world, meanwhile, was left to reckon with its inaction and silence during one of humanity’s darkest moments. In those three months, the world learned lessons about the power of division and the strength of reconciliation, understanding that even in the deepest darkness, flickers of light such as resistance and the will to rebuild can carry us towards dawn.
