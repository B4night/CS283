Once upon a time, there was a small island called Cuba. Cuba was a part of a country called the Soviet Union, which was a big country with lots of people and lots of power. There was another big country called the United States that was not very friendly with the Soviet Union.

One day, the Soviet Union decided to put some big guns called missiles on Cuba. These missiles could shoot really far and could hurt a lot of people in the United States. The United States was not happy about this and they asked the Soviet Union to take the missiles away.

The Soviet Union said no and the United States said they would do something about it. They started to get their army ready and the Soviet Union did too. The world was very worried because they thought there might be a big fight between the two countries.

But then, a smart man named John F. Kennedy, who was the president of the United States, came up with a good idea. He said that the United States would not attack Cuba if the Soviet Union took the missiles away. The Soviet Union agreed and they took the missiles away.

The world was very happy because there was no big fight and everyone was safe. The Cuban Missile Crisis was over and everyone learned that it was better to talk and solve problems instead of fighting.
