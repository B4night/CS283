The Gulf War began on August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to a series of events that would ultimately shape the course of history. This invasion was orchestrated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who sought to expand his country's territory and resources by annexing Kuwait. The United Nations Security Council quickly condemned the invasion and demanded that Iraq withdraw its troops from Kuwait. However, Hussein refused to comply, leading to a diplomatic crisis that would eventually escalate into military action.

As tensions continued to rise, a coalition of countries, led by the United States, began to assemble in the region. This coalition included numerous countries from the Middle East, Europe, and Asia, all of whom were united in their opposition to Iraq's aggression. The coalition's primary goal was to liberate Kuwait and restore its sovereignty. To achieve this objective, the coalition launched a massive military campaign, known as Operation Desert Storm, on January 17, 1991.

The war was fought primarily in the air, with coalition forces launching a sustained bombing campaign against Iraqi targets. This campaign, known as the "Desert Storm Air Campaign," lasted for several weeks and inflicted heavy damage on Iraq's military infrastructure. The coalition also deployed a large ground force, which launched a ground offensive on February 24, 1991. This offensive quickly overwhelmed the Iraqi forces, leading to their rapid retreat from Kuwait.

Despite the coalition's overwhelming success, the war did not end with the liberation of Kuwait. Instead, it continued with a ceasefire agreement, which was signed on February 28, 1991. This agreement called for Iraq to withdraw its forces from Kuwait and to accept international monitoring of its borders. The war had cost thousands of lives and billions of dollars, but it had also demonstrated the power of international cooperation and the ability of a coalition of countries to achieve a common goal.
