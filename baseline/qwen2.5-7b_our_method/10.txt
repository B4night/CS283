Once upon a time, the Roman Republic and the Carthaginian Empire were two powerful empires vying for control of the Mediterranean. Their conflicts came to be known as the Punic Wars, and they lasted for over a century. The first Punic War, which began in 264 BC, was fought over the control of Sicily. The Romans emerged victorious, and the Carthaginians were forced to pay a heavy war indemnity and cede control of Sicily to the Romans. The second Punic War, which began in 218 BC, was fought when the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca led his army across the Alps and into Italy. Although the Carthaginians were able to inflict heavy losses on the Romans, ultimately the Romans were able to defeat Hannibal and his army at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC. The third and final Punic War began in 149 BC, when the Romans demanded that the Carthaginians surrender their arms and dismantle their city walls. The Carthaginians refused, and the Romans launched a full-scale invasion of Carthage. The city was eventually destroyed, and the Carthaginian Empire was dissolved.
