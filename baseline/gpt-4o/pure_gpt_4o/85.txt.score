# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 23/25
The narrative is structured well with a clear beginning, development, and ending. It opens with the peaceful setting in Rwanda, transitions to the upheaval and Amina’s personal struggles during the genocide, and concludes with her contribution to the healing process as an adult. The plot points are logically connected, though the transition from forest refuge to post-genocide recovery could be slightly expanded for a fuller picture.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 15/20
The story leverages the historical context of the Rwandan Genocide, which is well-documented, reducing the novelty of the subject itself. However, it creatively presents the personal, coming-of-age journey of Amina, which adds a fresh layer of human experience and personal triumph amidst the tragic backdrop.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 19/20
The language is smooth, grammatically correct, and evocative, fitting the poignant and somber tone of the story. There is effective use of imagery and metaphors, particularly in describing the environment and emotional landscapes, which enriches the narrative.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 13/15
The story successfully evokes a range of emotions, from the initial innocence and joy to fear, resilience, and eventual hope. Amina’s journey is emotionally compelling, and the narrative communicates a strong message of endurance and healing, though it could delve even deeper into individual moments of emotional transformation for greater impact.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 8/10
Amina is a well-developed character whose growth is palpable from beginning to end. Her motivations and actions are consistent. However, other characters, like her parents, are less developed, serving more as background influences rather than fully fleshed-out figures.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 9/10
The setting is vividly painted, capturing the serene beauty as well as the subsequent chaos of Rwanda. The contrast between Kigali's past and present is effectively portrayed, and the forest refuge is depicted with sufficient detail to immerse the reader in Amina's challenges and growth.

## Final Score:
87/100
