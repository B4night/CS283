## Overall Feedback:

This story presents a dramatic and emotionally resonant recounting of a pivotal historical moment. Its strengths lie in its structure, emotional impact, and language, bringing depth to the significant act of signing the Emancipation Proclamation. While it leans heavily on historical fact, the creative presentation of Lincoln's inner thoughts and the widespread impact enhances its storytelling. Further character development for figures beyond Lincoln and a touch more originality could elevate it even more. A strong piece overall.
