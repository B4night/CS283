# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 18/25  
The story has a coherent structure with a clear beginning, development, and conclusion. It starts with the introduction of the financial crisis, develops through the experiences of various characters across the globe, and ends on a note of hope and resilience. However, the shifts between different characters and locations could be more seamlessly connected to enhance coherence.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 15/20  
The theme of global financial crises is not entirely novel, but the story weaves in the diverse perspectives of individuals and presents an original picture of resilience and hope. The narrative could delve deeper into unique personal stories rather than broad strokes to add a layer of more original depth.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 17/20  
The language is fluent and pleasant to read, with a professional and serious tone appropriate for the story's subject. Some sections captivate, such as Helen's symbolic chrysanthemum display, but further evocative language throughout could have heightened the storytelling.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 11/15  
The story evokes emotions tied to anxiety about financial instability and hope amidst adversity. While it successfully elicits a somber mood augmented by glimmers of resilience, individual character arcs could be more deeply explored to enhance the emotional journey.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 6/10  
Characters are distinct with clear roles in their respective environments; however, their development is somewhat superficial given the story's brevity. The motivations are clear, but further depth and exploration into each character's personal growth would add richness.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 8/10  
The story effectively paints a vivid picture of a world in crisis, from New York boardrooms to Dublinâ€™s streets. The diverse settings provide a broad view of the global situation, though greater sensory details could further immerse the reader in each locale.

## Final Score:
75/100

## Overall Feedback:
The story is a well-structured piece that effectively captures a global perspective on a financial crisis. Its strength lies in its diverse settings and the message of resilience. However, to elevate the narrative further, a deeper exploration of individual characters' psychological and emotional journeys could enrich the emotional impact. Enhancing connections between global scenes could also improve coherence, offering a more seamless flow through its panorama of the crisis.
