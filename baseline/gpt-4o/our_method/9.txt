The oppressive heat of the summer sun hung heavily over the ancient city of Babylon, casting long shadows across the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II. Inside the palace's grand halls, an unusual stillness pervaded, broken only by the quiet rustle of an attendant's robe or the distant mourning of royal peacocks. Here, surrounded by his faithful companions and generals, lay Alexander the Great, the once invincible conqueror of the known world.

The fateful days between the evening of 10 June and the evening of 11 June 323 BC marked the end of Alexander’s brief but prodigious reign. Rumors of his demise swept like wildfire through the city, reaching the ears of Macedonian soldiers and beyond, casting shockwaves across his vast empire. "The Lion of Macedon is fallen," a soldier whispered, choking on disbelief. Macedonians wept openly, their tears carving paths through the dust and grime on their faces, as locals lifted their voices in lamentation.

Yet not all hearts were weighted with sorrow. The Achaemenid subjects, still tethered to past grievances, were commanded to shave their heads—a stark symbol of change forced upon them. Far away, in the confines of her chamber, Sisygambis, the mother of Darius III, received the news of Alexander’s passing. The conqueror who had shown her mercy was gone, and in protest against the cruel twists of fate, she ended her own life.

Historians have since puzzled over the circumstances surrounding Alexander's demise. Was it illness, poison, or fate that snatched him away at the pinnacle of his ambitions? With each retelling, new theories emerge, weaving a tapestry of intrigue and speculation.

Within the walls of Babylon's grand palace, time seemed to stand still as the eminent men around him struggled to comprehend a world without Alexander's formidable presence. Generals and advisors gathered in clusters, expressions ranging from disbelief to calculating opportunism. Among them was Ptolemy, his mind racing through promises made over countless campaigns. Nearby stood Perdiccas, the weight of impending responsibility pressing heavily upon him.

Tales of Alexander's dying wishes began to circulate. Some spoke of leadership passing to the ‘strongest,’ sparking whispers of rivalry. Others recounted dreams of conquests and untold cities, leaving followers and generals entangled in myth and fragments of truth.

Beyond the emerald walls, the empire’s subjects faced their own uncertainties, from Egypt's plains to the distant rivers of India. As old conflicts threatened to rekindle, new alliances began to form in shadows. The women of the palace stood watchful—Roxana, carrying the king's heir, a beacon of hope; Olympias, absent from Babylon, yet her presence loomed large, sending declarations to preserve her bloodline.

In the twilight of his life, Alexander lay feverish and frail, caught in a battle beyond his control. Physicians hovered, faces etched with worry, while generals awaited his final commands. In his delirium, his gaze drifted through shadows unseen, his mind a hive of faded dreams and unrealized ambitions.

The absence of Hephaestion, his beloved friend, was keenly felt. As Alexander murmured once more about his friend, a tear traced his cheek—a testament to the endless void that beckoned. Opening his eyes, lucidly aware, Alexander whispered a name: "Roxana." A final tether to his life and love.

At last, his chest ceased its rhythmic rise and fall. The world paused, recognizing the passage of Alexander the Great into history, the greatest conqueror subdued by mortality. Outside, night creatures sang to an unkempt world, unaware of an empire now fractured by uncertainty. As dawn approached, threatening to paint the skies, a new chapter loomed undefined, waiting for the hands of fate to shape it.
