# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 20/25

The story provides a thorough historical overview of the events surrounding the Rwandan Genocide, including a clear beginning with the rising tensions and the attempted peace process, a development involving the genocide itself, and an ending touching upon Rwanda's journey towards healing. However, the narrative can feel more like a historical recount than a flowing story with a strong personal narrative arc. This detracts somewhat from its coherence as a unified story, but the sequence of events is logical and well-organized.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 12/20

While the story covers an important historical event with care, it largely adheres to historical facts without much deviation or imaginative expansion. Incorporating fictional characters like Suzana and Father Jean-Claude adds an element of originality and personal depth, yet the core narrative remains straightforwardly historical and lacks more creative storytelling techniques or perspectives.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 18/20

The language is fluent and suitable for the serious tone of the topic. Descriptions are vivid and articulate, and the narrative carries a somber yet hopeful tone that fits the theme appropriately. The syntax and grammar are nearly impeccable, which makes for an easy and engaging read.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 10/15

The story conveys the gravity and horror of the Rwandan Genocide effectively, invoking a somber emotional response. The addition of acts of courage amidst tragedy provides a poignant counterbalance. However, the emotional engagement could be deeper if the characters' personal stories were explored in more detail to provide a stronger emotional connection.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 6/10

The few characters mentioned, Suzana and Father Jean-Claude, are introduced as symbols of hope and resilience but lack in-depth development or backstories. Their motivations are clear but, due to the broad scope of the storytelling, they do not have the opportunity to evolve or show complexity.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 9/10

The setting is vivid and accurately describes the tension and aftermath of the historical events in Rwanda. The narrative effectively communicates the transformation of the country through both violence and healing. The environment and its impact on the characters and events are well depicted.

## Final Score:
75/100

## Overall Feedback:
The story effectively highlights the Rwandan Genocide by focusing on both the horror and the hope present during this period. While it succeeds in providing a clear historical recount, it leans more towards an informative piece than a personal narrative which could provide deeper emotional engagement. Developing individual characters further and weaving their personal stories into the broader historical events might enhance emotional connectivity. Nevertheless, the work conveys powerful messages of division and reconciliation, maintaining a tone and style that is respectful to the gravity of the subject matter.
