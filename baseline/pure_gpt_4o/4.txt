Once upon a time, in the mists of ancient history, beneath the rolling hills of what is now modern-day Italy, an event occurred that would shape the course of Western civilization for centuries to come – the founding of Rome.

Legend has it that Rome was born from the ashes of a fallen city, Alba Longa. The tale begins with the mighty hero Aeneas, who, after escaping the fiery destruction of Troy, traveled across the seas and landed on the shores of Italy, where his lineage would eventually lead to the foundation of Rome. However, Rome’s most celebrated founding story is not merely about origins, but rather it speaks to themes of destiny, survival, and the indelible power of myth.

In a time long past, the river Tiber flowed gracefully through lush landscapes, demarcating lands fertile for settlement. According to legend, these lands were ruled by a cruel and tyrannical king named Amulius, who usurped the throne of Alba Longa from his brother, Numitor. To secure his rule, Amulius forcefully silenced any who threatened his power, including Numitor’s daughter, Rhea Silvia. He consigned her to a life of perpetual maidenhood as a vestal virgin, ensuring she could never bear children who might avenge their grandfather.

Yet fate, with its curious twists, intervened. One fateful day, Rhea Silvia encountered Mars, the god of war. Enchanted by her beauty and strength, Mars bestowed upon her two sons, twins of divine lineage. In fear of Amulius, she hid their birth as long as she could. When the truth emerged, the wicked king ordered the twins to be cast into the Tiber River to meet their doom.

But destiny had not forsaken Romulus and Remus. The basket carrying the twins drifted to the banks of the river, where it snagged upon the roots of a wild fig tree. There, they were discovered by a she-wolf who, with maternal instinct, suckled and nurtured the infants. Eventually, a kindly shepherd named Faustulus stumbled upon the twins and, with his wife, raised them as his own, never revealing their royal and divine heritage.

As Romulus and Remus grew, so did their strength and spirit. Soon the brothers found themselves at odds with Amulius and, upon learning their true identity, resolved to claim their birthright. Together, they rallied supporters, embarked upon their perilous quest, and deposed the tyrant king, restoring their grandfather Numitor to the throne.

Emboldened by their victory and driven by dreams of their own legacy, Romulus and Remus set out to establish a new city along the banks of the Tiber. Yet, as is often true of legends, the path was fraught with difficulty. Rivalry broke out between the brothers over where the city should be founded. In a fateful turn of events, Romulus sought a divine sign to justify his choice and climbed Palatine Hill, while Remus positioned himself on Aventine Hill.

On the appointed day, Remus claimed to see six vultures, but Romulus asserted he saw twelve later in the day. The disagreement stirred tensions, and amid the struggle, Remus, skeptical of his brother's claims, leapt over the nascent city's boundary wall, casting doubt on Romulus's authority. Enraged by this challenge and impelled by destiny’s harsh demand, Romulus slew his brother in a tragic act that would haunt him through the ages.

Thus, with resolve and a heavy heart, Romulus set about founding Rome on April 21, 753 B.C., becoming the city's first king. Here, a civilization would rise, renowned for its governance, culture, and grandeur. Rome would become the eternal city, its founding myth interwoven with themes of conflict, fate, and divinity—the story of two brothers whose legacy paved the road for the ancient world to flourish and forever altered the chronicles of history. And so, under the watchful skies of an ancient world, Rome began its ascent to greatness, its origins forever rooted in legend and lore.
