In the early 20th century, Russia was a vast empire under the rule of the autocratic Tsar Nicholas II. Despite its immense size and resources, the nation was plagued by widespread poverty, rampant inequality, and social unrest. The people of Russia were growing increasingly disenchanted with the monarchy. A series of events would soon converge, unleashing a torrent of revolutionary fervor that would change the course of history.

In 1914, World War I broke out, further straining an already struggling Russian economy. The war effort was costly, both in terms of finances and human lives. Millions of soldiers were sent to the front lines ill-equipped and underprepared, leading to disastrous military defeats. At home, food shortages and inflation exacerbated the suffering of the common people. The dissatisfaction with the ruling class intensified, and whispers of revolution began to circulate among the populace.

By 1917, the situation had deteriorated to the point of open rebellion. In February of that year, a massive protest erupted in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg), the capital of Russia. Thousands of workers took to the streets, demanding better working conditions, food, and a change in government. Soldiers, sent to suppress the uprising, instead chose to side with the protestors, marking a critical turning point. Amidst the chaos, Tsar Nicholas II abdicated the throne, ending centuries of Romanov rule.

With the monarchy toppled, a provisional government was put in place, but it struggled to maintain control and failed to withdraw from the devastating war. The growing unrest set the stage for the second phase of the revolution. In October 1917, the Bolshevik Party, led by the charismatic Vladimir Lenin, seized the opportunity to overthrow the provisional government. Revolutionary slogans such as "Peace, Land, and Bread" resonated deeply with war-weary and impoverished Russians. The Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace, taking control in a nearly bloodless coup.

Once in power, the Bolsheviks moved quickly to consolidate their position. They redistributed land to peasants, nationalized industry, and withdrew Russia from the Great War by signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany. A bloody civil war ensued as the Bolsheviks faced resistance from a coalition of monarchists, capitalists, and various political factions, collectively known as the White Army. After a brutal conflict, the Bolsheviks emerged victorious.

The Russian Revolution culminated in the establishment of the Soviet Union, a socialist state that sought to reshape society under Marxist-Leninist principles. The revolution not only transformed Russia but also inspired a wave of leftist movements globally, altering the geopolitical landscape for the remainder of the 20th century. While the revolution promised a utopia of equality and justice, the ensuing decades revealed the challenges and contradictions of creating such a world, leaving a complex and lasting legacy.
