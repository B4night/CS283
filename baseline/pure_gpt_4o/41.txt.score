## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 18/20  
The language is fluent and complements the historical context, capturing both the era's atmosphere and the intellectual gravity of the occasion. Minor stylistic elements like spacing in "café'" can be optimized, but overall, the prose is polished and fitting.

79/100

## Overall Feedback:
The story masterfully brings a historical milestone to life with strong narrative structure and high language quality. While it captures the significance of Newton's work and era’s ambiance, it could benefit from increased creativity beyond historical facts and deeper character exploration. The piece succeeds in evoking intellectual excitement but may engage readers more deeply with additional emotional or imaginative elements.
