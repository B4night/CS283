# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 20/25

The story provides a clear sequence of events with a beginning (introduction of the referendum), development (campaigns and voting results), and an ending (consequences of the referendum). However, there is a lack of depth in exploring the development of events and characters within them, and potential inconsistencies in presenting the outcome impacts are not developed in detail.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 10/20

While the story deals with a real and well-known historical event, the retelling lacks a creative spin or novel interpretation. It essentially recounts the events without offering new insights or perspectives, making it more of an informational summary than a unique story narrative.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 16/20

The language is clear and grammatically correct, suitable for an informative style. However, the narrative lacks stylistic flair and does not convey a distinct narrative voice that might make the account more engaging as a story.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 5/15

The emotional impact is minimal as the narrative is presented in a factual and analytical manner. While the content suggests there are strong emotions involved, such as shock and division, these are not deeply explored or conveyed to generate strong emotions in the reader.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 3/10

The characters involved in the story (e.g., voters, campaigners, politicians) are not distinctly characterized, but rather grouped together without individualization. There's a lack of character motivation or exploration of how different groups processed and experienced the events personally.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 5/10

The setting of the UK during a historic event is presented, but thereâ€™s little depth into the atmosphere, locales, or detail that would immerse a reader into the time and place. It serves more as a backdrop rather than an integrated, engaging setting.

## Final Score:
59/100

## Overall Feedback:
The story functions effectively as a concise summary of the Brexit referendum, informing the reader about the events and outcomes from a factual standpoint. However, it lacks narrative creativity and emotional depth that would elevate it from a report to an engaging story. Opportunities for improvement include developing a unique storytelling angle, crafting distinct character voices, and enhancing emotional and immersive elements.
