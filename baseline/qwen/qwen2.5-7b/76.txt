The Cuban Missile Crisis was a tense 13-day period in October 1962 when the world was on the brink of nuclear war. The crisis began when US spy planes detected Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba, just 90 miles from the US coast. The United States demanded that the missiles be removed, and the Soviet Union refused, leading to a dangerous standoff between the two superpowers.

President John F. Kennedy and his advisors debated their options, considering everything from a military strike to a diplomatic solution. Finally, they decided to blockade Cuba, preventing any more Soviet ships from entering the island. The Soviet Union, meanwhile, began to mobilize its forces in response to the blockade.

The world held its breath as the two sides prepared for war. But in the end, a diplomatic solution was found. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev agreed to remove the missiles from Cuba, and the United States promised not to invade the island. The crisis was over, and the world breathed a sigh of relief.

In the aftermath of the crisis, Kennedy and Khrushchev established a direct communication channel between the two superpowers, known as the "hotline." This allowed for faster and more direct communication between the leaders in the event of another crisis. The Cuban Missile Crisis had been a terrifying moment in history, but it also led to important steps towards preventing future conflicts.
