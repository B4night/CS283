The Edict of Milan was a momentous event in the history of Christianity. It was issued in 313 AD by Emperor Constantine and his co-emperor Licinius, and it marked the end of the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. The edict declared that Christianity was to be tolerated throughout the empire and that all Christians were to be free to practice their faith without fear of persecution. This edict paved the way for the eventual legalization of Christianity and its rise to become the dominant religion in the Roman Empire.
