Once upon a time, in the 7th century, a small Arabian Peninsula was ruled by the Quraysh tribe, who were the most powerful in Mecca. The people of Mecca were polytheistic and worshipped many gods, including Allah, who was the chief god. However, there was a growing number of people who were becoming increasingly frustrated with the lack of spiritual guidance and the corruption of the religious leaders.

One of these people was Muhammad, who was born into the Quraysh tribe and was known for his wisdom and kindness. He began to preach a new religion, Islam, which taught that there was only one god, Allah, and that all people were equal in his eyes. Muhammad's teachings were met with resistance from the Quraysh tribe, who saw him as a threat to their power and influence.

Despite this, Muhammad continued to preach his message, and his followers grew in number. However, the opposition from the Quraysh tribe became increasingly violent, and Muhammad and his followers were forced to flee Mecca for Medina, a city located 250 miles to the north. This event is known as the Hijra, and it marked the beginning of the Islamic calendar.

In Medina, Muhammad was able to establish a new community based on his teachings, and he continued to preach and spread his message. Over time, Islam spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, becoming one of the world's major religions. Muhammad is revered as the prophet of Islam, and his teachings continue to inspire people around the world to this day.
