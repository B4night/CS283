Adolf Hitler, a charismatic and cunning leader, began his rise to power in Germany in the aftermath of World War I. The country was in a state of economic and social turmoil, and many Germans were looking for a strong leader to restore order and stability.

In 1932, Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazi Party, became the largest party in the German Reichstag, or parliament. However, he was unable to gain a majority and had to form a coalition government with other parties.

In 1933, Hitler used a fire that broke out in the Reichstag building as an excuse to declare a state of emergency and suspend civil liberties. He then persuaded the German President to grant him dictatorial powers, and he became Chancellor of Germany.

As Chancellor, Hitler began to implement his policies of racial purity and expansionism. He expelled Jews and other minorities from government and society, and began to build up Germany's military and economy. He also began to expand German territory, first into Austria and then into Czechoslovakia.

In 1939, Hitler invaded Poland, starting World War II. He quickly conquered much of Europe, but his plans for world domination were ultimately thwarted by the Allied forces.

Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933, marking the beginning of one of the darkest chapters in human history.
