Once upon a time, in the year 1990, a region called Kuwait was occupied by a neighboring country called Iraq. The people of Kuwait were very sad and scared because they were not safe in their own land. They asked their friends and neighbors, the United States and other countries, to help them. 

So, a big group of soldiers from different countries, including the United States, went to Kuwait to fight the bad people from Iraq. They called this group the Coalition Forces. The leaders of the Coalition Forces made a plan to free Kuwait from the bad people. 

The Coalition Forces started to attack the bad people in Iraq. They used airplanes, tanks, and other big machines to fight them. The war was called the Gulf War. It was a very long and difficult war, but the Coalition Forces finally won. 

The people of Kuwait were very happy because they were free again. They thanked the Coalition Forces for their help. The leaders of the United States and other countries were also happy because they had helped their friends and neighbors. 

The Gulf War was an important event in history because it showed that when people work together, they can overcome even the biggest problems. And it also showed that it is important to stand up for what is right and to protect those who cannot protect themselves.
