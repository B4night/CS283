## Overall Feedback:
The story provides a factual recounting of the Wright brothers' first flight, presenting a clear and cohesive narrative with a beginning, middle, and end. While informative, it lacks originality and creativity, as it simply recounts a well-known historical event without offering new insights or perspectives. The language is fluent and well-structured, making it easy to read. However, the emotional impact is limited as the story is more descriptive than immersive. The characters, although historically significant, are not deeply explored beyond their basic contribution to aviation. The setting is adequately captured, providing context to the achievement, but could benefit from more sensory detail to enhance the reader's immersion. Overall, while the story is informative, it could be improved by exploring the characters' motivations and emotions and providing a more inventive narrative approach.
