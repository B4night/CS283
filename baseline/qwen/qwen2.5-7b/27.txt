His writings provided Europeans with their first glimpse of this mysterious land and helped to inspire future explorers to venture further east. 

In addition to his writings, Marco Polo also brought back many treasures from China, including silk, porcelain, and spices. These goods were highly prized in Europe and helped to establish trade relations between the two continents.

Overall, Marco Polo's journey to China was a transformative experience that helped to shape the world in ways that are still felt today.
