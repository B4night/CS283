The 95 Theses, posted by Martin Luther on October 31, 1517, on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, Germany, sparked a movement that would eventually lead to the Protestant Reformation. The 95 Theses challenged the Catholic Church's practices, particularly the sale of indulgences, which were seen as a way to buy forgiveness for sins. Luther believed that salvation was a gift from God and that the Church should not be able to sell forgiveness for sins. The 95 Theses quickly spread throughout Germany and Europe, sparking controversy and debate. Luther's ideas resonated with many who were disillusioned with the Catholic Church's practices and teachings. Despite the Church's efforts to silence him, Luther continued to write and preach his message of salvation through faith alone. His ideas eventually led to the Protestant Reformation, a movement that sought to reform the Catholic Church and establish new, more pure forms of Christianity. The Reformation had a profound impact on the course of history, leading to changes in politics, culture, and religion.
