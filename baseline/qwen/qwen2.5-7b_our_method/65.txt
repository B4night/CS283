Once upon a time, in the roaring twenties, the United States was experiencing a period of economic prosperity. People were buying stocks, investing in the market, and making money. However, there was a big problem that no one saw coming. The stock market was too big and too complex, and it was all a big bubble waiting to burst.

One day, the bubble finally burst. The stock market crashed, and people lost all their money. This caused a chain reaction, and soon the economy was in shambles. People lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings. It was a disaster.

The Great Depression had begun. It was a time of great hardship and suffering for millions of Americans. Families lost everything they had, and the government had to step in to help. But it was a long and difficult road to recovery.

In the end, the Great Depression taught us a valuable lesson about the importance of economic stability and the dangers of overreliance on the stock market. It was a dark period in American history, but it also helped to shape the country into what it is today.
