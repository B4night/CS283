- The plot points are logically connected, chronologically presenting his discoveries and their impacts without abrupt jumps.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 12/20
- While the story conceptually presents an important historical account, it doesn't introduce novel perspectives or imaginative elements. The retelling of well-known historical facts lacks a creative twist or fresh angle.
