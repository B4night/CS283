In the early 1990s, Rwanda, a small Central African country known for its lush landscapes and rich cultural heritage, was on the brink of a devastating tragedy. The country was predominantly made up of Hutu people, who constituted about 80% of the population, and Tutsi, who were a minority estimated at around 20%. Historically, Hutus and Tutsis had coexisted for centuries, with the Tutsis having a more prominent role in the political and economic spheres due to their historical leadership in colonial times.

However, by the early 1990s, political tensions between the two groups had reached a boiling point. Extremist Hutu groups, such as the National Republican Movement for the Defense of the Hutu (MRCD) and the Interahamwe ("Those who Kill"), began to incite violence against the Tutsi community, spreading false rumors that the Tutsis were planning to dominate the country and eliminate the Hutus. These groups were fueled by a genocidal ideology that viewed the Tutsis as a threat to Hutu dominance.

The catalyst for the genocide was the assassination of the Hutu president, Juv√©nal Habyarimana, on April 6, 1994, as his plane was shot down upon arrival in Kigali, the capital. This event sparked widespread violence, with Hutu extremists leading mobs to attack Tutsi civilians and moderate Hutus who opposed the violence. The killings were organized, with local officials and military personnel often coordinating and participating in the atrocities.

In Kigali, the first major attacks occurred on April 7, with thousands of Tutsis being hacked to death with machetes, beaten, or burned alive in their homes. The violence spread rapidly across the country, with entire villages being wiped out. The Tutsis, who made up a small percentage of the population, were targeted en masse, and the international community initially struggled to comprehend the scale of the violence.

A key factor in the genocide was the use of radio as a tool for propaganda and incitement. The Hutu extremists utilized radio broadcasts to spread fear and hatred, ordering Tutsis to surrender or face death. This method of communication was highly effective in organizing and coordinating the attacks across the country.

As the violence intensified, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) convened an emergency meeting, but the international community's response was slow and limited. The UN peacekeeping mission, known as UNAMIR, was undermanned and lacked the resources to protect the vulnerable population. The delay in intervention by the international community allowed the genocide to escalate unchecked.

By the end of June 1994, the genocide had claimed the lives of approximately 800,000 Tutsis and hundreds of thousands of Hutus who opposed the extremism. The international community was left reeling from the failure to prevent such a tragedy, and
