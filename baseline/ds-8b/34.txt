Hernán Cortés, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan in November 1519, seeking gold and glory. He presented himself as an emissary of the Spanish king, but his true intentions were to conquer the Aztec Empire. Cortés and his men were initially welcomed, given gifts, and allowed to establish a settlement.

However, the Spanish were met with suspicion by Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor, who sensed their deceit. Despite this, Cortés managed to gain the trust of some Aztec nobles and set up a base in the city. Over time, the Spanish faced challenges, including sickness from unfamiliar food and the spread of smallpox among the Aztecs. Cortés, however, remained strategic, planning an attack during a Aztec festival when the people were intoxicated and off guard.

On November 20, 1521, Cortés and his forces launched an assault, overwhelming the Aztecs. Montezuma II was captured and later killed, while his successor, Cuauhtémoc, was taken prisoner. The Spanish looted the city, seizing its treasures, and enslaved many Aztecs. The fall of the Aztec Empire marked the end of a once mighty civilization, with its people forced into a new reality under Spanish rule.

The conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernán Cortés was a pivotal moment in history, not only for the Spanish but also for the indigenous peoples, whose lives were forever changed by the arrival of European conquistadors.
