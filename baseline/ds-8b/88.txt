On the morning of September 11, 2001, the world changed forever as terrorist attacks unfolded in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania. Four passenger planes were hijacked by 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists, who carried out suicide missions aimed at destroying key targets.

The first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, departed from Boston bound for Los Angeles. At 8:46 AM, it crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The second plane, United Airlines Flight 175, took off from Newark, New Jersey, and crashed into the South Tower at 9:03 AM.

Meanwhile, American Airlines Flight 77 from Washington's Dulles International Airport hijacked and crashed into the Pentagon at 9:38 AM. Finally, United Airlines Flight 93, which had departed from Newark, was hijacked and crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, at 10:10 AM after a brave passenger struggle.

The attacks resulted in the loss of 2,977 lives, including 125 law enforcement officers, 2 firefighters, 47 rescue workers, and 23 EMTs. The aftermath was devastating, with massive search and rescue operations, identification of remains using DNA, and the eventual recovery of victims' remains from the wreckage.

In the following days, memorials began to appear across the U.S., honoring the victims and the heroes who risked their lives. The 9/11 Commission was established to investigate the attacks, leading to increased national security measures and the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The events of 9/11 are a stark reminder of the cost of terrorism and the resilience of the human spirit. The world continues to honor the lives lost and the bravery of those who responded, ensuring that the legacy of 9/11 inspires unity and vigilance against terrorism.
