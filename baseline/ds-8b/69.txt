The night was thick with tension, the air heavy with the weight of anticipation. The men of the 101st Airborne Division, known as the "Screaming Eagles," lay low in their crafts, their hearts pounding with a mixture of fear and determination. They were part of the largest amphibious invasion in history, a mission that had been planned for months, every detail meticulously considered. The fate of the war, and perhaps the world, rested on their success.
