It was a crisp November afternoon in Dallas, Texas, as John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, rode through the city in a motorcade. The sun was shining brightly, and the streets were lined with cheering citizens eager to catch a glimpse of their beloved president. The motorcade made its way through Dealey Plaza, passing the Texas School Book Depository building. Little did the crowd know, this would be the site of one of the most tragic events in American history.

As the president's limousine approached the Depository, shots suddenly rang out. The first shot struck Kennedy in the neck, causing him to slump forward in his seat. The second and third shots were aimed at his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, but remarkably, she managed to escape serious injury. The fourth and fifth shots were directed at the president again, one of which proved fatal. The assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was standing on the sixth floor of the Depository, firing a Mannlicher-Carbine rifle through a hole in the window.

The crowd erupted in chaos as the president's limousine sped toward Dallas General Hospital. Secret Service agents and Texas Rangers immediately sprang into action, but their efforts to save the president were in vain. John F. Kennedy was pronounced dead 20 minutes later. The news of the assassination sent shockwaves across the nation. People gathered in front of their TVs, stunned and grief-stricken.

In the aftermath, Oswald was arrested and charged with Kennedy's murder. Before he could stand trial, he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby, a Dallas nightclub owner, in a dramatic, live TV appearance. The assassination raised many questions, and the U.S. government launched an investigation known as the Warren Commission. Their report concluded that Oswald acted alone, but this findings were met with skepticism from many who believed there was a conspiracy involving other figures, including Fidel Castro or the Soviet Union.

Decades later, the assassination remains a topic of intense debate. While the Warren Commission's conclusion that Oswald was the sole assassin is widely accepted, theories persist about additional shooters and deeper motivations. The events of that day continue to captivate the nation, reminding us of the fragility of life and the enduring mystery of one of the most infamous crimes in history.
