The War in Afghanistan began in the early 1970s, a conflict that would leave a lasting mark on the history of the region. It was a time of upheaval, as the once-quiet villages of Afghanistan were beginning to grumble under the influence of Communist ideologies seeping in from neighboring countries.

In a small, remote village nestled in the mountains, a young boy named Hassan lived with his family. Hassan was just a child, but he had a sharp mind and a curious nature. He spent his days wandering the hillsides, learning the old ways of his ancestors, and listening to the stories passed down through generations. But as the years went by, he began to hear whispers in the village square—whispers of a new way of thinking, a system where the state controlled everything.

At first, Hassan didn't understand what these whispers meant. He had always known that his father was a respected religious leader, and the villagers turned to him for guidance. But as the whispers grew louder, Hassan noticed that some of the older men gathered in secret, speaking in hushed tones. He didn't know what they were planning, but it made him uneasy.

One day, a group of strangers arrived in the village. They were not like the villagers; their clothing was different, and their faces were marked by determination. They introduced themselves as members of the Communist Party, there to spread their ideas. Hassan watched from a distance as they began to talk to the village elders. The elders listened intently, nodding as the strangers explained their vision of a society where everyone worked together for the good of all.

Hassan was intrigued. He had always been taught that the old ways were the best ways, but now he heard stories of equality and fairness that made him question those teachings. The strangers also promised land and resources, and Hassan couldn't help but notice how quickly the village elders seemed to accept their ideas.

His father, though, remained silent. Hassan knew his father was worried, but he never spoke of it. Instead, he kept his thoughts to himself, unsure of what to believe.

One evening, Hassan sneaked out of the village to watch the Communists at work. He saw them taking land from the wealthier villagers and distributing it among the poor. He saw them organizing the youth into groups, teaching them about revolution. Hassan felt a mix of emotions—excited by the change he saw, yet scared of what it might mean for his family and his way of life.

As the weeks went by, the tension in the village grew. The Communists became more assertive, taking more land and resources, and the villagers began to divide. Some supported them, while others, like Hassan's father, remained skeptical. Hassan tried to talk to his father, but his father wouldn't reveal his true feelings. Instead, he gave Hassan a look that told him to stay out of it.

One night, Hassan heard his father whispering to a neighbor. "They
