The Scramble for Africa, also known as the Race for Africa or the African Partition, was a period of intense competition among European powers to claim control over African territories. This event marked the beginning of the colonial era in Africa and had profound and tragic consequences for the continent.

The Scramble for Africa began in the late 19th century, driven by the Industrial Revolution and the desire for raw materials such as rubber, ivory, and minerals. European countries, including Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, and Italy, sought to exploit Africa's resources and establish colonies. The competition was fierce, with each nation vying for dominance over specific regions.

The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 was a pivotal moment. It brought together European representatives to discuss the division of Africa, leading to the establishment of the Congo as a private colony controlled by King Leopold II of Belgium. This event set the stage for further colonial claims and the partitioning of Africa among the European powers.

As the Scramble progressed, countries like Britain and France secured significant territories, while smaller nations such as Portugal and Spain also staked their claims.
