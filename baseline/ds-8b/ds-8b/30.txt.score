## Overall Feedback:
The story offers a well-structured account of Columbus's voyage with a clear beginning, middle, and end. It effectively covers the historical events but could benefit from deeper exploration of the characters, especially Columbus, beyond the surface-level depiction in a largely factual recounting. While the language is fluent and the style suits the tone, the piece heavily leans on known historical events, leaving limited room for creativity and originality. Emotional impact is modest, as it could have delved deeper into the psychological and emotional states of the characters involved. The world-building is solid, offering a vivid backdrop of the 15th-century setting, yet more personal details and perspectives could enhance the overall narrative impact.
