Once upon a time, in a small town called Bethlehem, during the time of King Herod, there was great turmoil. The skies were dark with the news of a census commanded by Caesar Augustus, which required everyone to return to their hometowns to be taxed. Among the travelers was a young woman named Mary, who was with child by the Holy Spirit. Her betrothed, Joseph, was a carpenter from Nazareth, and they were on their way to Bethlehem for the census.

The journey was long and arduous, Mary's belly heavy with the promise of new life. They arrived in Bethlehem, only to find the innkeeper had no room, for the town was full.
