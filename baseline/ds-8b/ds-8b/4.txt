Once upon a time, in the heart of Italy, there was a small hill where two twin boys, Romulus and Remus, were raised by a she-wolf. The legend says that a she-wolf found them as infants, suckling them with her milk, after their mother, a princess, had been killed by their jealous stepfather. The twins were known for their strength and wild spirit, often seen wrestling and fighting, which earned them the name "Roma" and "Remus."

As they grew older, the twins had a disagreement. Romulus believed that the hill they called home was the perfect spot to build a city, while Remus thought they should settle elsewhere. In a fit of anger, Romulus killed his brother with a sword. Heartbroken, Remus was laid to rest on the hill, and Romulus, unable to bear the loss, wandered away. It is said that he wandered the land, weeping, until he was taken in by a kind old woman who raised him as her own son.

Years passed, and Romulus grew into a young man. One day, he had a vision of a great city that would one day be built on the hill where he had lost his brother. Inspired by this vision, he returned to the hill and began to build a city. He divided the land into fields and streets, creating the foundation of what would one day be Rome. He also built strong walls to protect the city, and the people who joined him began to call the hill the "Capitol."

According to legend, Romulus laid out the streets and avenues of the city, ensuring that they were straight and well-organized. He also established the first form of government, with himself as the leader and a group of wise elders advising him. This was the beginning of the Roman Republic, a system of government that would later become a cornerstone of Western civilization.
