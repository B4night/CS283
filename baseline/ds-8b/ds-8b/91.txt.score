# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 20/25

The story provides a clear development of events starting with the housing market issues and leading up to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. However, it lacks a resolution or an explicit conclusion, leaving an abrupt ending that omits the recovery part implied in the title.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 15/20

The story covers well-known events from a historical perspective, which limits its originality. While it’s insightful, it doesn’t offer new perspectives or imaginative takes on the financial crisis.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 18/20

The language is clear, concise, and suits the informative tone of the financial crisis narrative. It is smooth and easy to read but lacks varied stylistic elements that could add depth to the narrative.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 10/15

The story manages to evoke a sense of urgency and concern about the financial crisis, especially during the Lehman Brothers collapse. However, it could delve deeper into the human aspect and emotional consequences to enhance its impact.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 4/10

There are no specific characters developed in the story. It focuses more on institutions and events. Had it included individuals’ perspectives or those directly affected by the crisis, it would have scored higher in this category.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 7/10

The setting of the global financial world is outlined effectively, providing a clear context of the crisis. However, the lack of specific locations or vivid descriptions limits the immersive quality.

## Final Score:
74/100

## Overall Feedback:
The story provides a coherent and informative account of the global financial crisis' early stages, focusing on macro-level events and institutions. While it effectively conveys the seriousness of the financial turmoil, it lacks individual perspectives that could enrich emotional impact and character depth. Additionally, the abrupt ending leaves the narrative incomplete as it misses exploring the recovery phase alluded to in the title. Adding a broader time frame and more human experiences would enhance its storytelling quality.
