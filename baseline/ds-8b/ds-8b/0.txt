The story begins in the fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, a place known as Mesopotamia, often called the Cradle of Civilization. The land was abundant with resources, and the rivers provided life-giving water and fertile soil. The people, skilled hunters and gatherers, soon realized the potential of the land. With the discovery of agriculture, they began to cultivate crops, leading to a surplus of food.

As the surplus allowed for more than just sustenance, trade began to flourish. The early people bartered goods, and soon, small communities formed around areas where trade was most active. These communities grew into cities, and the first cities in Mesopotamia were born.

The city of Ur, with its towering ziggurat dedicated to the moon god Luna, became a center of religious and cultural significance. Similarly, Uruk, known for its impressive walls and grand public buildings, was another early hub of civilization. These cities were not just places of residence; they were centers of commerce, religion, and governance.

The invention of writing, around 3300 BCE, marked a significant milestone. The development of cuneiform script enabled the recording of laws, trade agreements, and religious texts. This innovation facilitated the organization of society and the keeping of records, which were essential for the functioning of cities.

The invention of the wheel, around 2500 BCE, further revolutionized daily life. Wheeled vehicles, like chariots, were used for transportation, and plows improved agriculture. These advancements allowed for more efficient trade and the growth of cities.

The cities of Mesopotamia were not just centers of human activity; they were places of innovation and progress. The people of these cities laid the foundation for future
