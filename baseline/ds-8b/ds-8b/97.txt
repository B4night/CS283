The fall of Kabul on August 15, 2021, marked a stark turning point in Afghanistan's history. The Taliban, after years of conflict, had finally regained control of the capital, leading to the collapse of the Afghan government and the surrender of President Ashraf Ghani. The city, once bustling with life, now stood in silent submission as the Taliban took over key installations and imposed their rule.

For shopkeeper Mohammad, who had run his store for decades, the day brought a mix of sorrow and fear. "I saw people rushing to withdraw money, panic in their eyes," he recalled. "I’ve never seen Kabul like this." The sudden shift left many without jobs, and the economy, already fragile, began to crumble.

In the heart of the city, 25-year-old Safia* faced her own struggles. As a women's rights activist, she had worked tirelessly for gender equality. Now, with the Taliban in power, her work seemed under threat. "I don’t know if I can continue," she said, her voice trembling. "But I have to keep going for the women who still believe in change."

Internationally, reactions were divided. While some Western leaders condemned the Taliban's takeover, others called for a humanitarian approach. United States President Joe Biden emphasized the need for a new Afghan regime, while leaders in the region urged calm. The humanitarian crisis began to unfold as thousands fled the capital, seeking safety and aid.

The days that followed were uncertain. The Taliban promised a return to traditional values and stability, but the future remained unclear. For now, Kabul stood under their rule, its fate intertwined with the hopes and fears of a nation. The world watched, hoping for peace but bracing for more chaos.
