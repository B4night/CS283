The rise of Augustus marked the beginning of a new era in Roman history, as he transitioned the Republic into an Empire. Following the turmoil of the late Republic, characterized by political instability, violent conflicts, and social unrest, Augustus emerged as a unifying figure who brought peace and order to the fractious city-state of Rome.

The foundation of the Roman Empire under Augustus was shaped by the events leading up to his ascension.
