# Story Evaluation

## 1. Structure and Coherence (out of 25): 
Score: 20/25

The story presents a clear narrative with a beginning that sets the historical context, a development that details the rising tensions and outbreak of violence, and a conclusion highlighting the devastating consequences and international response. However, the ending feels abrupt, as it stops mid-sentence, which detracts from a completely coherent conclusion.

## 2. Creativity and Originality (out of 20):
Score: 12/20

The story draws on historical events, which inherently limits its originality. While it portrays these events with some depth, it doesn't introduce new perspectives or novel interpretations that might help it stand out creatively. It follows a straightforward retelling of historical facts.

## 3. Language Fluency and Style (out of 20):
Score: 16/20

The language is generally fluent, clear, and well-structured, appropriate for the historical tone of the narrative. It is informative and precise, although the style is more expository than narrative, which may not engage readers looking for a story-driven piece.

## 4. Emotional Impact (out of 15):
Score: 10/15

The story does evoke emotions such as sadness and anger due to the tragic nature of the events it covers. However, the emotional impact could have been stronger had there been more personal stories or detailed experiences to draw readers in and create a deeper connection to the narrative.

## 5. Character Development and Consistency (out of 10):
Score: 3/10

The story lacks character development, focusing more on groups and historical actions rather than individual characters. The absence of specific characters to guide the narrative limits emotional engagement and reader investment in personal stories or motivations.

## 6. World-Building and Setting (out of 10):
Score: 7/10

The setting of Rwanda in the early 1990s is depicted with enough detail to understand the socio-political climate. The use of radio as a tool for propaganda adds depth to the setting, but more descriptive elements about daily life or cultural context could enhance immersion.

## Final Score:
68/100

## Overall Feedback:
The story effectively presents a significant historical event with clarity and structure. Its strengths lie in its informative nature and historical accuracy. To improve, it could benefit from more narrative-driven elements such as detailed characterizations and an emotionally engaging storytelling style. A stronger, more conclusive ending would also enhance coherence. Adding these elements could elevate the narrative from a factual recount to a compelling story with broader resonance.
